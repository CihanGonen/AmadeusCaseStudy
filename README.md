# Amadeus Case Study - Flight Search Application

This projectis developed as a case study.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

###  `npm install`

And after that start json-server by 

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

and start react app

### `npm start`


## Things I want to mention

Project consists of two pages one is the home page that we have our form. The other is list page that we list flights.

## Home page

![home](https://github.com/CihanGonen/AmadeusCaseStudy/assets/48177270/cbce9262-a331-4f9f-9a0c-e2fc5ae6a5b4)

## List page

![list](https://github.com/CihanGonen/AmadeusCaseStudy/assets/48177270/6139c600-8c0b-4a70-af1c-ee1a16a8d032)

Even though I can create a server or use a api. Since I created this project for UI Developer case, i demonstrated my skills on state management and UI Development. Therefore I used simple json-server api and the datas that i created with the help of AI. So I kept my sample small with 5 airports and 100 flights to try out different cases.

## Suggestion

I usually used form with these inputs so i also suggest you to try it

from -> Ä°zmir Adnan Menderes
to -> Antalya
departureDate -> 05-09-2023
returnDate -> 06-09-2023
round trip -> chosen

With these inputs we can see round trip flights.

I would love to talk about the project more and explain it in great detail! Thanks for reading.
